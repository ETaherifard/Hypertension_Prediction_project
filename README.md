# Prediction of hypertension using machine learning approaches 
Here is the code utilized for our research study using the R program 4.3.1 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria). In this project,  we used data from a group of individuals without hypertension in the southern region of Iran. We proceeded to observe this cohort over five years, assessing the occurrence of hypertension during this timeframe.

Hypertension is one of the most common modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases with a complex etiology and different risk factors involved. Investigating hypertension risk factors is among the most efficient strategies, and helps to develop preventive strategies to reduce the burden of the disease, especially in low- and middle-income countries where health resources are limited.

In this study, we applied and compared the accuracy, precision, and performance of different Machine Learning approaches for the prediction of hypertension; these approaches were: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Linear Discriminant Analysis. 

Given that this study is currently undergoing the review process and has not been published yet, we regret to inform you that we are unable to provide further specifics about the project at this time. Once the study has been published, we will update the relevant information accordingly.
